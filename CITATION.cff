  In the ever-evolving landscape of medical research and
  healthcare, the abundance of scientific articles presents
  both a treasure trove of knowledge and a daunting
  challenge. Researchers, clinicians, and data scientists
  grapple with vast amounts of unstructured information,
  seeking to extract meaningful insights that can drive
  advancements in the biomedical domain including, research
  trends, patient care, drug discovery, and disease
  understanding. This paper utilizes the topic extraction
  algorithms on Breast Cancer Research to shed light on the
  current trends and the path to follow in this field. We
  utilized TextRank and Large Language Models (LLM) using
  the TripleA tool to extract topics in the field, analyzing
  and comparing the results.
